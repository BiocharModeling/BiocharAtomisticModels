This version is applicable for molar ratios of O/C ≤ 0.217 and H/C ≤ 0.627 and elemental composition, including C, H, N, and O.
Structures are constructed based on pyrolysis temperatures ranging from 400°C to 700°C. You can still use the code at temperatures outside this range if your biochar sample falls within the applicable H/C and O/C ratios. Simply select the nearest available temperature in the code. For example, if your experiment was conducted at 750°C, use 700°C in the code instead.
1. Download the folder and keep the files where they are.
