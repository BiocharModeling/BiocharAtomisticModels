This version (v3) applies to molar ratios of O/C ≤ 0.33 and H/C ≤ 0.89 and elemental composition, including C, H, N, O, S, P, and F. Structures are constructed based on the acid pretreatment applied prior to carbonization. The experimental pyrolysis conditions after treatment are 500°C and > 300 psi. You may use the code for temperatures outside this range, provided your biochar sample falls within the applicable H/C and O/C ratios.
