This version (v3) applies to molar ratios of O/C ≤ 0.33 and H/C ≤ 0.89 and elemental composition, including C, H, N, O, S, P, and F. Structures are constructed based on acid pretreatment used for pyrolysis conditions of 500°C and > 300 psi. You can use the code at temperatures outside this range if your biochar sample falls within the applicable H/C and O/C ratios.
