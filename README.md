### Figure 1. Methodology to interpret characterization data and obtain atomistic representations of biochar. 
*Randomly select n-molecules to include the n-functional groups needed. Molecules can be selected multiple times, except for the inclusion of holes. 
Modifications are sequentially illustrated for the same molecule, but the process involves randomly selecting the molecule for each step.
