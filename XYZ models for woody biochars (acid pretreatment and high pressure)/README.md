These atomistic models are for woody biomass pretreated with acid and pyrolyzed at 500Â°C and high pressure. See full details in the following paper: 

The final 3D arrangement may vary each time the code (Biochar.ipynb) is run due to the random spatial organization of the modified clusters in the grid (as shown in Step 13 of Figure 1) and the minimization procedure used (Step 15, Figure 2). However, the chemical and physical properties of the final 3D representation should remain close to the experimental values.
